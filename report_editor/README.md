Report Editor
=============
LaTeX is too heavy and complicated to work with. It's hard to make a good
layout and the biggest flaw is that you can't easily change layout
(stylesheet) in the end.

### A new simple report editor
A cross operating system editor where you can easily edit text and output to
pdf and HTML. Internal structure would be based on HTML and CSS for easier
styling.

### Library support

 * A HTML to PDF library.
 * A Markdown library for inport and export of markdown information.
 * A export feature to export to static websites.
 * Some kind of Math equation presentation library.
