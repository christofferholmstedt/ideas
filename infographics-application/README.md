Infographics application
========================
"The daily infographics", it should be easy to share specific dynamic
infographics online on a daily basis. This require the application to be
flexible when it comes to importing data (as well as exporting for those
interested). The same data should be able to be presented in different
types of charts.

Wordwide infographics
---------------------
Suger correlation with diabetes.

Municipality infographics
-------------------------
My municipality reports yearly the last year economics outcome as well as
other measures, it comes in a several pages thick PDF. It's not very easy
to read through and the statistics is not very easy overviews.

Gapminder is a great tool but it has it limitations and its focus is worldwide,
not very local.

### Proof of Concept
  1. Gather the information from Västerås Municipality about the school system
     costs.
  2. Gather information about student socioeconomics.
  3. Add all this to easy, user-friendly free infographics.

(With "free" this is meant to be free software as in GPL3 License or similiar)
