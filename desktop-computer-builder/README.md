Desktop Computer Builder
========================
When building a desktop computer from discrete components it's sometime
hard to remember all the components you need for a complete system. It's
also hard to know which components work together.

A 3D desktop application where available components from different webshops
are available in a click and drag fashion to build a complete computer before
buying the components.

### Basic features
1. Do each component work with the other component selected, e.g. does the
memory work with the motherboard and chipset?
2. Do each component fit together in selected case?
3. Be able to create and share different computer setups (just like EVE online
ship setups).
