==================

### Blocksite depending on current time
  * As a developer you sit in front of the computer for many hours straight.
Somedays you can keep focus on the important stuff but somedays you keep
returning to facebook or your favorite website every few minutes to see if
there has been an updated. For this you need a virtual friend (the plugin) that pushes you
in the right direction. Depending on if it's working hours, lunch break or what
time it is the virtual friend should block/allow specific websites.
##### Short ideas
  * Allow webemail between 8-9 and 16-17.
  * Allow facebook all hours except 8-12 and 13-17.
