Distributed phonenumber blacklist
=================================
In Sweden a big problem for small one person companies are telemarketers (also
valid for non-companies as well). You could set up a local black- or whitelist
or your phone but it would be really easy for telemarketers to just call from
new numbers all the time. That battle would never be won.

Instead if several people comes together and build a black- or whitelist
together and share that information with everyone else the telemarketers would
never stand a chance to keep up with switching phone numbers. As soon as one
call is made from a new phone number everyone else that is subscribed to the
same list would block that number.

### Assumptions
  1. You don't accept hidden phone numbers at all.

### First implementation
  1. Android
  2. Easy user interface to add phonenumbers that just called you.
  3. Easy user interface to add phonenumbers from your call history.
  4. Easy interface to maintain and modify a list.
