Municipality infographics application
=====================================
My municipality reports yearly the last year economics outcome as well as
other measures, it comes in a several pages thick PDF. It's not very easy
to read through and the statistics is not very easy overviews.

Gapminder is a great tool but it has it limitations and its focus is worldwide,
not very local.

Proof of Concept
----------------
  1. Gather the information from Västerås Municipality about the school system
     costs.
  2. Gather information about student socioeconomics.
  3. Add all this to easy, user-friendly free infographics.

(With "free" this is meant to be free software as in GPL3 License or similiar)
