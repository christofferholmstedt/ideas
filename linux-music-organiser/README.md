Linux music organiser
=====================
I use Ubuntu on all my computers and it's a pain to try to organise my music
arhive, mostly big FLAC files. I could by more space in Ubuntu One but I don't
find that option appealing.

I want to be able to synchronise music between two laptops and a FLAC player.
Obviously the devices won't be connected to eachother or online at the same
time except on rare occasions.

### Features
  1. Connect and synchronise music archive over TCP/IP-network.
  2. Synchronise playlists.

### Use case #1
I buy a new music album from Humblebundle.org. I extract it to my music
directory on my desktop computer. I start the linux-music-organiser application
and it detects the added files. From the application I can add the different
songs to different playlists which are stored in a specific directory of the
music directory.

The entire music directory is then synched on command between my desktop
computer and my laptop (both computers are online and connected to the same
LAN network).

### Use case #2
The same as above except that it's one android phone connected to the WiFi
network running interoperable software to sync the music.

### Use case #3
I create a playlist and drag and drop move music files as well as playlists to
my FLAC player. These playlists require special formatting per device so I
don't store these and synced them. Instead they are formatted to the correct
format when a playlists is transfered to a device.

The work flow could be as follow. I create a new playlist on my desktop
computer and transfer it to my FLAC player. I later update this playlist on my
laptop and transfer it again to my FLAC player. The old playlists is
overwritten for the new one on the FLAC player.
