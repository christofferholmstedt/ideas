Food planning application
=========================
Main goal is to easily make a plan the upcoming week/month concerning what to
eat and when to buy the groceries.

### Minor ideas
  1. Track specific products in subcategories and categories
  2. Make food recipes based on subcategories and categeries
  3. Layout of local stores so the grocery list is ordered according to the
     store layout.
  4. Detailed information about different products, its substances/ingredients
     and how/where they are manufactured. Transportation(?).
