Food planning application
=========================
Main goal is to easily make a plan the upcoming week/month concerning what to
eat and when to buy the groceries.

### Motivation
  1. Make everyday life easier, less time spent on planning and shopping more
     time spent on cooking good food (healthy and environmental friendly).
  2. With personalised quantities for each dinner suggestion, less amount of
     food will be thrown away.
  3. There is always one in a family that is more eager to plan ahead of time.
     For the others to be able to keep up the system must be userfriendly and
     very easy to use so the hurdle to plan is not too big.

### Minor ideas
  1. Track specific products in subcategories and categories
  2. Make food recipes based on subcategories and categeries
  3. Layout of local stores so the grocery list is ordered according to the
     store layout.
  4. Detailed information about different products, its substances/ingredients
     and how/where they are manufactured. Transportation(?).
