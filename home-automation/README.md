Home Automation
===============
In this project "idea" I list all the the functionality and features I want at
home to make my everyday life easier and more fun.

### Sensors
1. Temperature sensors
    For temperature inside in each room as well as outdoor temperature.
2. Pressure sensor
    Outdoor pressure.
3. Humidity sensor
    Outdoor and fridge humidity.
4. Air quality sensor
    Air Quality Egg perhaps(?).

### Actuators
1. Wireless light switch.
2. Dimmer for lights.

### Bigger projects
Sensors and actuators are fun, especially when the goal is to make them as
energy effecient as possible so they can run on small batteries for years.
Though at some point you need to make something out of all
sensors/actuators, this is when the "bigger projects" tie everything together.

##### Sleep control
Different things such as what you have been doing and what you have been
eating/drinking during the day effects how well you sleep. The goal with this
application is to suggest improvements to your daily routines and help you
control the home with the main goal to improve sleep.

With mesaurements on how well you sleep and when you go to bed the lights can
be dimmed in reasonable amount of time before it's time for sleep.
Notifications can be sent to various devices to tell you that it's now time to
turn off. As a concrete example it's pretty bad to brush your teeth in a bright
lit room when the light could be dimmed to not effect your body before sleep.

##### One entertainment system for entire home
Be able to simple add and remove speakers as well as sound/video sources to the
network and play anything in any or all rooms.

##### Food planner
An application that can be used to plan the upcoming week(s) dinner plans,
grocery shopping and so on. It should consist of a library of different
recipies and user/group (family) managment tool.

'''Some initial questions'''
1. How to keep a complete list of all the groceries already home up to date
online?

'''Some initial requirements'''
1. Web server accessible both from home and away from home.
2. Web interface so it's accessible from all kinds of devices. (At home while
   planning or at the store while shopping).

##### Air quality
Air quality measurments in all rooms measuring temperature, CO2 could be
combined with fire alarms. At least one outside as well to compare the air
quality, if it's bad outside it won't be better inside.

This could also be used to measure sudden drops in temperature outside and how
long it takes to adjust the indoor temperature in big buildings.

Sound sensors in stereo could be used to measure/count cars passing by outside.
