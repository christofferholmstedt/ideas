Home Automation
===============
In this project "idea" I list all the the functionality and features I want at
home to make my everyday life easier and more fun.

### Sensors
1. Temperature sensors
    For temperature inside in each room as well as outdoor temperature.
2. Pressure sensor
    Outdoor pressure.
3. Humidity sensor
    Outdoor and fridge humidity.
4. Air quality sensor
    Air Quality Egg perhaps(?).

### Actuators
1. Wireless light switch.

### Bigger projects
Sensors and actuators are fun, especially when the goal is to make them as
energy effecient as possible so they can run on small batteries for years.
Though at some point you need to make something out of all
sensors/actuators, this is when the "bigger projects" tie everything together.

##### One entertainment system for entire home
Be able to simple add and remove speakers as well as sound/video sources to the
network and play anything in any or all rooms.

##### Food planner
An application that can be used to plan the upcoming week(s) dinner plans,
grocery shopping and so on. It should consist of a library of different
recipies and user/group (family) managment tool.

'''Some initial questions'''
1. How to keep a complete list of all the groceries already home up to date
online?

'''Some initial requirements'''
1. Web server accessible both from home and away from home.
2. Web interface so it's accessible from all kinds of devices. (At home while
   planning or at the store while shopping).
