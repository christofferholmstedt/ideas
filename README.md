Repository with ideas for applications
======================================
At my blog [I wrote in february 2013 about "14 days and 5
ideas"](http://www.chho.se/2013/02/17/you-must-be-willing-to-die-for-it/).
Most of us developers thinks of new ideas each day or even each hour when we go on
with our everyday life. Most of these ideas never turn into something real.

The process to pick those few that are worth the time to develop is hard
because you don't know if it really solves a problem or not. I believe you need
some structure to identify your best ideas. A few developers write about
"You must be willing to die for it" and I like that way of thinking, unless
you really really want it, don't do it.

For me this has turned into my rule "14 days and 5 ideas". Basically I need to
think of one single application/idea for 14 days straight until I give myself
the "go" to actually start coding. At this point I must only write down 5 key
points/goals and start writing code from there.

The purpose with those two rules are
  1. Start only with the ideas that you really think you will find useful
  2. Try to create a running program ASAP and don't spend too much time making
the perfect design.

### What will this project include
This git/github project will include all my ideas I come to think of and within
each idea description I will try to keep track for how many days straight I
think of it.
