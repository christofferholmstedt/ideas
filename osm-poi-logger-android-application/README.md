OpenStreetMap Point of Interest Voice Logger
============================================
OpenStreetMap gets more and more details added to it each day and especially in
the cities road networks are more or less complete. The focus is shifting
towards adding and keeping points of interest up to date. This could be
anything from local shops to historical monuments as well as building
numbers/house numbers.

To add this kind of information on the fly outdoors is not easy on a mobile
phone or even a bigger tablet. It would be interesting to see if a voice
recorder together with a simple OSM map and GPS could help.

### Use Case #1
Application launches. On front screen a map is displayed in the top part with
your GPS position shown on the map. In the bottom part of the screen a record
button is available that you press and you start the voice recording and you
describe all the details you see.

When you get back home your recorded sessions are sent to your email and while
listening to them you add all the information in front of your desktop
computer.

### Use Case #2
Similiar to #1 but instead of using GPS positioning you point on the map your
current position and in which direction you're standing. While turning around
360 degrees you describe what you see and you also get a marker in which
direction you're looking.

(Might not be so useful to play on your desktop computer if you don't have a
desktop application that can show the direction information).

### Featuers
  1. Simple OSM map
  2. Voice recording
  3. GPS tracking
