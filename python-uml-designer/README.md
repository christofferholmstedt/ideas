Python UML Designer
===================

### A new UML open-source tool
  * During different courses at the university I've come across several tasks
where UML is required or it would be nice to draw different diagrams to make
life easier in future tasks. Dia is the leading open-source software written in
C and is more or less complete. The drawback for the use case above is that Dia
is very flexible so different diagrams can be mixed back and forth.

##### Short ideas
  * UML designer written in Python with PyQT for faster
    prototyping/development.
  * Just like Dia load different Diagram types dynamically from specified
    folder.
  * Base the storage on XML or similiar open format.
  * Be able to generate SVG.
  * The key difference from Dia (except language) would be that the different
    diagram types are specified in greater detail to match standards such as
    OMGs SysML. This would make life easier for new user to overcome the first
    learning step.
