Emergency Robots
===============
Robots get smarter and smarter for each generation of microcontrollers and they
also get cheaper so more can be done with less. During 2014 it starts to become
reasonable to discuss how multiple, that is, 20 or more smaller robots could
co-operate when searching through a building in the case of a fire.

Even smaller robots could be built to search for survivors under debris in the
case of earthquakes.
