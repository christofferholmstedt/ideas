Time Logger
===========
For some projects you have limited and planned amount of hours you have
available. For example one task must not take more than 75% of your total
amount of work hours.

### Basic use-case
1. Define the overall amount of hours, finishing deadlin of the project.
2. Define the different categories.
3. Define how many percent each category should take out of the total amount of
   hours.
4. Show total amount of hours per category.
5. Plan how many hours should be spent per day.
6. Show hours completed per category and in total.
7. Show hours left per category and in total.
8. Show percentage done per category and in total.
9. Show amount of worked hours up until, and including today, in hours; in the
format of amount of hours completed relative to those planned. So if you have
worked more than plan it's green and if it's fewer it's red.

### Lessons learned from Master thesis planning
1. Log hours by entering start time and finishing time, let the application
   count minutes, hours and percentage.
2. Make it possible to add multiple time ranges per day.
