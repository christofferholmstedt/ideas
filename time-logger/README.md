Time Logger
===========
For some projects you have limited and planned amount of hours you have
available. For example one task must not take more than 75% of your total
amount of work hours.

### Basic features
1. Log hours per different tasks
2. Show weekly, monthly and yearly overviews.
3. Warn if I'm using to many hours on one task. As an example if I have 10
   hours on "extra tasks" for each week and on tuesday I've used 8 of those 
some warning should go off/show.
