Public services
===============
Our society is a balance act between (1) the government (including counties,
municipals and all the organizations they operate, (2) all the people living
in the society and (3) the free press. All three parts are linked together in a
network and the power inbetween must be in balance for a society to thrive. (A
fourth player is all the for-profit businesses though it is tightly coupled with
the government through lobbying and laws).

### The balance has shifted with internet
With the possibilities given with new technology balance has shifted towards
the government and lobbying organizations. Laws are put in place to
surveilliance all citizens without proper ruling from court on a per-case
basis. The few rulings that actually take place are hidden in secrets courts,
under strict confidentiality.

To balance this out all citizens must be given easier access to decisions made
by politicians and informations about who each politician meets must be public.
Some changes requires law but a lot can be done with just a webserver and
graphics.

### Ideas
1. A website where all the decisions made by politicians are made public and
   easy sorted/browsed.
    * Including easy viewing of each politician's social media channels.
2. A version control system that show the entire law book and the changes
   made to it by new laws introduced by politicians. (This can also give
   easier access to the actual laws that are in place already).
3. A website showing which company owns which in a tree diagram. This would
   give all citizen the possiblity to actually see how the tangled world of
   business ownership is linked together.
