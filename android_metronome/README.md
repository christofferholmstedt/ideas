Android Metronome for runs
==========================
When out running one key aspects is to keep the proper pace or rather strides
per minute. The goal is to start with 180 strides per minute and adapt a little
to what feels right.

The main obstacle is to first reach 180 strides per minute, first time you try
it, it will feel like you are a cartoon character running like there is no
tomorrow. Though, after a few weeks or months with regularly practice it will
feel really good.

### Use case
During the practice period you need some help to keep the pace at 180 strides
per minute or close to it. Your android phone can help you with this. You
should also  be able to just log your strides with the accelerometer and when
you get back home be able to analyse it.

Thirdparty applications should be able to tie in to the metronome to be able to
use that in their own apps.
