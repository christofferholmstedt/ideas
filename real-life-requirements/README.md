Real Life Requirements
======================
A desktop application that takes user input as normal prose requirements,
connect requirements to solutions and creates a Requirements Diagram over
all requirements and solutions.

### Goal
When buying more expensive stuff such as a bicycle, laptop, desktop computer,
car or a house you want to make a well thoughtout decision. You rarely come
up with all your needs and requirements on a single day, you think of them
one at a time and it could take weeks between each of these occasions.
To write down all these ideas/"want to haves"/musts on a checklist with
yes and no option and then when the day comes and you want to make a decision
you tick them off, one by one. It works for simple things such as bicycles and
perhaps even a computer but for a house with some dependencies between
different needs and solutions a graph is a much better way of organising it.


### Example 1
You're going to buy a new laptop. You want the laptop
to weigh less than 1.5 kg but still be able to play the latest games for future
LANs you're going to attend. After some initial research you realise that
no computer meet your needs. What to do?

You come up with the solution that next desktop computer you buy should be a
micro ITX with a good handle in the chassi so you can bring that one together
with a screen to the next LAN. The laptop you buy can with this solution weigh
way less than first anticipated.

The thoughtprocess described above doesn't tkae place over a day probably
over the time period of weeks. The "Real life requirements" application
would help you remember all the ideas and solutions you come up with and
organise them so when you make a new solution you are sure you don't forget
about a previous need that the new solution doesn't take care of.

### Example 2
Another example could be that you're planning to buy a house or an apartment,
how big should it be? how many rooms? how far from closest city centre
should it be?

You decide that you want a big garage for storing outdoor activity equipment.
A few months later you find a perfect house except that it lacks the garage.
With "Real life requirements" application you can easily see which requirements
you would not meet if you take this otherwise perfect house.
