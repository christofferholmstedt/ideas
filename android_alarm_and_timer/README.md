Android Alarm Clock and Timer
=============================
There are literally hundreds of different alarm clocks and timers available on
Google Play but those that I have tried always miss some vital feature. One
such feature is the possiblity to schedule a reoccuring timer.

### Use Case
I want to do something every 20 minutes between the hours of 08:00 and 12:00.
The important part here is that I don't need to reset the timer after the first
timer goes of.
