Budget application
==================
To not earn enough money is stressful but even more stressful is not knowing
exactly how much you spend each month. This budget application's main goal
is to just summarise monthly/yearly income and expenses and keep track
of transactions.

### Key features
  1. Track transactions (income/expenses)
  2. Summarise transactions by different timespans (at least monthly)
  3. Categories/tag transactions
  4. Be able to summarise by categories and tags
  5. You can create a budget, categories returning transactions, after a month
     or two the application can suggest a new budget from previous months.

##### Main though about categories and tags
Categories are used for monthly/yearly "big" types such as housing, food,
repairs (un)planned expenses. Tags are used for other types of expenses such as
"swimming gear", "training gear" and travel. Tags could also be looked at
as subcategories.
