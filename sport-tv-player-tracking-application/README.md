Sport TV Player Tracking
========================
Professional Sport TV shows such as NHL, NFL and NBA in USA as well as
Elitserien in Sweden all has somekind of "overlay" when discussing different
plays. An example to this could be to highlight a player when he/she has the
puck.

These features doesn't exist in OpenSource software what I'm aware of but with
OpenCV it would be possible to create features like that.
