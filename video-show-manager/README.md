Video Show Manager
==================
When streaming live from a computer it would fun to easily be able to add and
remove different overlays to the show as well as playing different cut scenes.

### Use case #1
Like Day9, uses different overlays depending on which show it is and who the
sponsors are.

### Use case #2
Different cut scenes should be played on command, prepared intros and outros.

### Use case #3
Overlay statistics depend on some other information such as game time, some
kind of score between two teams. It should be easy to extend the application
with some module that fetches that kind of information "online".
