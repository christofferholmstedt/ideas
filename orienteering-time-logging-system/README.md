Orienteering Time Logging System
=================================

### Vision
Time logging systems today are mainly proprietary systems with heavy
applications to manage it and short battery life, 12 hours is way to short. The
goal with this system would be an open hardware and software (GPL3) system with
the following main goals.

##### Use available open standards and technology
Technology such as HTTP and PGP can be used to sign information in different
nodes to be able to validate checkpoint activations. OpenStreetMap can be used
as background layers for map information. There should be a webtool to manage
all the equipment to allow multiple terminals (computers/laptops) to be
used as management tools.

##### Low energy usage
At least 48 hours of battery life when thousands of users activate a single
checkpoint node throughout the 48 hours. Possibility of running these nodes
with solar energy.

##### Use equipment there is an abundance of
Everyne has a smartphone today and within a couple of years most of us will
have a phone with NFC support. Instead of forcing everyone to aquire some
specific hardware NFC devices should be supported.

### Main Success Use Case Scenario
TODO

### Each checkpoint node
1. GSM/3G(?)/4G(?)/Wifi(?) conncection for live updates over internet.
2. NFC activation of node.
3. Possibility for other activation modes, bluetooth LE perhaps?
4. Memory for storing activation information.
